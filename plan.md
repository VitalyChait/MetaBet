Goal:

To build a platform that can detect users of predicition market platforms such as Polymarket with an execeptional high winning rate (TBD: maybe >80%). 
Usually it should be a specific domain.


How to:
1. Scrape the web / social media the detect users
2. Validate the information with Polymarket (Win rate, Profit/Loss rate, number of bets)
3. Make DB with users that passes the TH
4. Monitor users for "Active" bets
5. Update the DB if an active bet was completed
