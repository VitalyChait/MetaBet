Unknown,"The Federal Reserve has turned into a finance soap opera.

Let me break down what's actually happening:

- President Trump threatening to fire Jerome Powell.
- Administration pressuring the Fed for aggressive rate cuts.
- Housing Director Bill Pulte uncovering mortgage fraud from a Fed Governor.
- Legal battles over presidential firing authority.
- Stephen Miran replacing Adriana Kugler on the Board of Governors.

This level of chaos is unprecedented for America's central bank.

But here's where it gets interesting.

Kevin Hassett now sits at 83% odds on Polymarket to become the next Fed Chairman. Trump dropped a major hint yesterday during a White House appearance.

Who is Kevin Hassett?

A supply-side economist focused on unleashing economic growth through tax cuts, deregulation, and accommodative monetary policy. He prioritizes growth over very strict inflation control.

His ""4% Solution"" outlines a roadmap for sustained 4% GDP growth through tax certainty, spending restraint, and energy deregulation. Classic Reagan-style economics.

The most interesting detail? Hassett is a former Coinbase advisor who reportedly still holds a sizable stake in the cryptocurrency exchange.

So what are the market implications?

Lower interest rates. Pro-growth monetary policy and a Fed Chair with direct ties to the crypto industry.

Whether you agree with the approach or not, this represents a fundamental change in how the Fed might operate going forward.

Unknown,"I found a Google insider profiting $1.3M on Polymarket.

So I built an AI automation to copytrade him.

Here's the thing:

He's won every single Google-related bet he's placed.

Every. Single. One.

And everything he does is public. On-chain.

So I built a 2-page prompt that:

>Scans his wallet every 24 hours
>Filters for Google-related markets only
>Detects cluster buys
>Alerts me the moment he loads up

By 8am, I know if he opened a new position.

Then I decide: do I want to follow his move?

Tomorrow, I'm giving you the entire AI system in my newsletter.

The workflow.
The logic.
The exact prompt.
